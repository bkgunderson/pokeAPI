# Pokémon API Exploration

I wanted to share some data via an API (Application Programming Interface) but realized I was still lacking skills at how APIs are consumed and documented. I recalled seeing [a well-documented API](https://pokeapi.co) for data on the Pokémon game series, so I thought I would try building an interface that pulls in some of that information.
